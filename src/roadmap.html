    <h1>  SSOA Pilot Summary</h1>
    <h2>What is SSOA?</h2>
    <p>

        SmallScaleOceanAccess, a data economy for coastal community and seafood industry resilience.
        Taglines
        SSOA: data-driven decision-making for coastal communities and the seafood industry.
        SSOA: a circular economy for coastal data.
        <h3>How does SSOA create resilience?</h3>
        By de-risking and stabilizing assets/investments in coastal communities / the seafood industry.
        How does SSOA de-risk and stabilize assets?
        By providing trustworthy, secure, high-resolution data to data consumers on the status/activities of these assets/investments; and
        By providing data that enables protective measures to secure these assets.
        <h3>Where does SSOA’s data come from?</h3>
        Directly from its users, referred to as data producers.
         <h3>How does data move throughout the SSOA ecosystem?</h3>
        Every time data changes hands, that’s a transaction; data flows one direction (producer to consumer) in exchange for a predefined benefit flowing in the other direction (consumer to producer). Thus, data producers are incentivized to create, process, and share data.
        Each transaction is mediated by a smart contract. The terms of the smart contracts are defined by the data producers and data consumers.
    <h3>Why do data producers participate in SSOA?</h3>
        Because they benefit from sharing and/or processing data.
    <h3>Is SSOA a data hub?</h3>
        No. SSOA is built on Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs). So, it’s more like a network of data highways connecting sources to destinations. In this analogy, in order for cars (data) to use these highways (SSOA digital infrastructure), cars must pass through toll booths (smart contracts) first before they can arrive at their destinations (data consumers). In order to pass through tollbooths, cars must be the right size (terms/conditions of the smart contract specific to the data owner) and cars’ destinations must pay tolls (terms/conditions of the smart contract specific to the data consumer). If cars are the right size and tolls are paid, cars pass through toll booths, use the highways, and arrive at their destinations.
        SSOA is decentralized. It’s a network of peer-to-peer transactions.

        SSOA Initial Pilots
        Shrimp farming in Yogyakarta
        Partners: JALA, SFP, Longline Environment, IDH, CI
        Use-case: making data exchange and evaluation scalable for an insurance agreement.
        Background: JALA, a technical services startup, is piloting an insurance program with shrimp farmers in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. If farmers comply with a set of terms defined by the insurer, they will be eligible for insurance payments in the event of a disease outbreak. Farmers must share data as evidence of their compliance with these terms and as evidence of a disease outbreak. The initial plan is for this data to be conveyed in the form of written reports. However, this is not scalable for thousands of farmers. Thus, SSOA will automate this process. Data will flow directly and continuously from farmers through smart contracts which (using this data) will automatically assess whether these terms are being met, and whether a disease outbreak has occurred. If a disease outbreak occurs, a payment will be sent to the farmer.
        Small-scale fishing in Ambon
        <h3>Partners: SEANODE (Ph2), Pattimura University, Regional Development Chief Ambon, Fisheries Development Lead Ambon</h3>
        <h4> Use-case: monitoring ecosystem health for corporate investors and university research.</h4>
        Background: Ambon currently has many small scale fishers who have no access to markets, distribution, or processing facilities for their products. It also is trying to restore the ecosystem through collaborative university-government projects focused on mangrove rehabilitation and regenerative seaweed agriculture. However, there is limited data informing these restoration efforts. Thus, SSOA will deploy aquatic sensors on the boats of small scale fishers in Ambon to gather high-resolution aquatic data for continuous, near-real-time ecosystem monitoring. This data will inform the restoration projects, as well as be incorporated into an Ambon-wide ecosystem health program. This program will ensure the long-term viability of this region’s resources. The data produced from this program will serve as evidence of this environmental viability for corporate investors. These investors will build and operate distribution and processing facilities in Ambon contingent upon evidence of the community's continual commitment to and success of its ecosystem health program.
        Phase 2: Several agencies within the Indonesian national government currently collect water quality data for various purposes including marine spatial planning. However, none of these agencies collaborate to collect this data, their collection methods vary, and the data is never shared. This results in redundant effort, incomplete information, and inefficent spending. For phase 2 of this project, SSOA will build integration smart contracts between the water quality data collected in Ambon and the various government agencies’ water quality monitoring efforts in Ambon to efficiently provide them with high-resolution, consistent data.
        Small-scale fishing in the Bicol region
        Partners: WWF Philippines, EMB, PAGASA, Bicol University, BFAR (Ph2), FAME (Ph2)
        Use-case: aquatic data collection to inform severe weather early warning systems, waterbody classification, and a coral reef health assessment.
        Background: Seafood plays a key role in the economy of and daily lives of the people in the Bicol region of the Philippines. As such, the health of its aquatic ecosystem is critically important to Bicol communities. Bicol University has been collaborating with the regional government to conduct a coral reef assessment for health and community development purposes. Originally, this assessment was not going to contain physical aquatic parameters besides temperature as obtaining this data was determined to be too challenging. Additionally, for the purpose of informing regional planning and conservation decisions, the Environmental Management Bureau (EMB) of the Philippines government currently classifies Philippine waterbodies. Once classified, the waterbody is dedicated for certain activities and regulations specific to those activities are outlined. Classification is a one-time process. It requires year-long data collection, but once classified, data is rarely collected. Lagonoy Gulf has not yet been classified by the EMB even though the classificiation of this waterbody could help provide a regulatory foundation which the local communities could use to organize their development and conservation activities. The activities of Bicol University and EMB are two programs which could benefit greatly from high-resolution coastal aquatic data. Thus, SSOA will deploy aquatic sensors on the boats of small scale fishers to gather this data and thus enable continuous, near-real-time ecosystem monitoring. This monitoring data will inform the University’s assessment so as to better ascertain the true health of the coral reef, and will enable the classification of Lagonoy Gulf by EMB.
        Phase 2: The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Management (BFAR) of the Philippine government has an existing program for monitoring water quality in several waterbodies across the Philippines. The monitoring data is used to help predict harmful algal blooms (HABs) and fishkills. However, to-date, this monitoring has been confined to just freshwaterbodies as obtaining adequate data for coastal regions using traditional methods is too costly and laborious. HABs have not been reported in the Lagonoy Gulf, but are found in several other coastal areas in Bicol. Thus, SSOA will expand its sensor deployment to fishers in other areas within Bicol so that BFAR can begin providing HAB predictions to coastal communities in the area.
        Phase 3: Currently, an early warning system is in place throughout the Philippines for severe weather events like typhoons, but this system’s predictions are based on satellite and atmospheric data only, not aquatic data.* However, in the realm of weather prediction science, new coupled ocean-atmospheric models have been developed by a few research centers, and PAGASA is interested in exploring this approach. PAGASA’s collaborators at the University of the Philippines have been trying to research this topic, but their ability to do so has been constrained by an absense of aquatic data. Therefore, SSOA intends to provide this data to the researchers at the University of the Philippines, and once their models are developed, eventually to PAGASA. This data will inform a new coupled oceanic-atmospheric model run to improve PAGASA’s ability to predict severe weather events. Although the Bicol region is one of the areas most frequently ravaged by severe weather like typhoons, predicting weather specific even to just one region still requires data on the surrounding regions. Thus, the data collected by SSOA’s initial efforts in Lagonoy Gulf will be insufficient to improve weather predictions for the gulf. Thus, SSOA will expand its deployments across the Philippines to cover the entire coastaline. To do this, it will leverage all of WWF’s fisher sites, as well as those of the University of the Philippines. This data should be adequate to imporve the accuracy and specificity of PAGASA’s severe weather predictions for several regions within the Philppines as well as the country as a whole.
        *Note: a few select regions have newly-installed radar sensors to measure wave height and velocity. No areas measure in-situ temperature or chemical parameters.
        Small-scale fishing with Rare Philippines
        Partners: Rare Philippines, Wilis Towers Watson, TBD others
        Use-case: Creating a scalable coastal insurance scheme for fishing communities.
        Background: Rare is collaborating with WTW to implement an insurance scheme for Philippine fishers. However, no insurance scheme has ever been implemented to protect against non-physical damages to sensitive ecosystem assets like coral reefs or fishing grounds, partly due to the lack of data available to monitor these assets. Thus, SSOA will deploy aquatic sensors on the boats of small scale fishers in a TBD community to gather high-resolution aquatic data for continuous, near-real-time monitoring of the community’s aquatic environmental assets. Data will flow directly and continuously from fishers through smart contracts which (using this data) will automatically assess the status of these assets. If an environmental stress event occurs (such as conditions known to often result in coral bleaching, fish die-offs, etc.), payments will be sent to a community task force which will use these funds to  implement several emergency response actions during and immediately following the stress event. These actions will help the community and the asset cope with and recover from the stress event.
    <h3>Bomb Fishing in Indonesia</h3>
        Partners: TNC Indonesia, Hasanuddin University, Taman Nasional Indonesia
        Use-case: Creating an affordable, trustworthy, effective method for communities to detect, catch, and successfully prosecute bomb-fishers
    <h3>Background:</h3>
        Pilot Site #1: Sape- The coastal community of Sape in Bima is a main landing, trading, and processing hub for the seafood activity in the region. TNC Indonesia has an existing, successful project with a group of snapper, grouper, emperor fishers who use traditional gears, and who are concerned about protecting their environment and community. Approximately 3 years ago, several fishers began using bombs when fishing and now roughly 80% of fishers frequently use bombs. Bomb fishing is frowned upon within the community, but enforcement is lacking and supposedly the bomb fishers often have favorable connections to local government officials. Both the fishers using bombs and those who are not understand that if the practice continues, within a few short years, most of the fish will be gone and the fishers will thus have to switch to a different livelihood or move somewhere else.
        Pilot Site #2: Kapoposan- The island community of Kapoposan located a few hours off the coast of South Sulawesi consists of mostly small-scale fishers who are dedicated to protecting their ecosystem. Many fishers come from the surrounding islands to catch grouper. Those using bombs sell their catch dead, and those using cyanide mainly keep their catch alive to sell for a higher price. All fishers are part of a patron system; they sell their catch to these patrons and rely on them for boats, gear, and money. The Kapoposang fishers live within the confines of a National Park and Marine Protected Area, and have been collaborating with national authorities to try to stop bomb and cyanide fishing in their waters. However, to-date, this effort has been ineffective because of the low detection rate, information delays, and lack of evidence to support claims.
        Solution: Thus, SSOA will deploy underwater hydrophone arrays on the boats of cooperative fishers / along the island shore to detect bomb explosions. When detected, the explosions will send a real-time alert to the local authorities containing the exact location of the explosion which will enable the authorities to swiftly capture the perpetrator. The system will also keep a record of this event which can be used as evidence for prosecution. For this use-case, there is no need for a DLT-based system. A traditional, centralized data hub is sufficient.
